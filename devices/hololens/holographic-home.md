# Navigate the Windows Mixed Reality home

## [Navigating MR Home](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/navigating-the-windows-mixed-reality-home)

## Use the Start menu

The **Start** menu on HoloLens is where you'll open apps and get to the HoloLens camera.

Wherever you are in HoloLens, you can always open the **Start** menu by using the [bloom gesture](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures) on HoloLens (1st gen) or tapping your wrist on HoloLens 2. Usually, you'll use it once to get to **Start**, but sometimes you might need to use it twice.

> [!TIP]
> When the **Start** menu is open, use the start gesture to hide it again.

At the top of the **Start** menu, you'll see status indicators for Wi-Fi, battery, and volume, plus a clock. The tiles are your pinned apps. To talk to Cortana, select her tile, or just say "Hey Cortana" from anywhere on HoloLens. At the bottom you'll find the photo and video icons, which open the camera app.

To see the rest of your apps, select **All apps**. To get back to **Start** from the **All apps** list, select **Pinned apps**.

## Use apps on HoloLens

Apps on HoloLens use either 2D view or holographic view. Apps with 2D view look like windows, and apps with holographic view surround you and become the only app you see.

### Open apps

You'll find your apps either pinned to **Start** or in the **All apps** list. To get to the **All apps** list, use the bloom gesture to go to **Start**, then select **All apps**.

On **Start** or in the **All apps** list, select an app. It will open in a good position for viewing.

>[!NOTE]
>- Up to three 2D app windows can be active at a time. You can open more, but only three will remain active.
>- Each open app can have one active window at a time, except Microsoft Edge, which can have up to three.
>- If you're having problems with apps, make sure there's enough light in your space, and walk around so HoloLens has a current scan. If you keep having trouble, see [HoloLens and holograms: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13456/hololens-and-holograms-faq) for more info.

## Move, resize, and rotate apps

Moving and resizing apps on HoloLens works a bit differently than it does on a PC. Instead of dragging the app, you'll use your gaze, along with a [gesture](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures) or the [clicker](hololens-clicker.md). You can also rotate an app window in 3D space.

> [!TIP]
> Rearrange apps using your voice&mdash;gaze at an app and say "Face me," "Bigger," or "Smaller." Or have Cortana move an app for you: say "Hey Cortana, move &lt;*app name*&gt; here."

### Move an app

Gaze at the app, and then do one of the following.

- Tap and hold to select the app. Move your hand to position the app, and raise your finger to place it.

- Select **Adjust**,&nbsp;tap and hold, and move your hand to position the app. Raise your finger to place it, then select **Done**.
- Select **Adjust**, click and hold the clicker, and move your hand to position the app. Release the clicker, then select **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> If you drop apps when you move them, make sure to keep your hand in the gesture frame by following it with your gaze.

### Resize an app

Gaze at the app,&nbsp;and then do one of the following.

- Gaze at a corner or edge of an app window, and tap and hold. Move your hand to change the app's size, and raise your finger when you're done.

- Select **Adjust**. Gaze at one of the blue squares at the corners of the app, tap and hold, then move your hand to resize the app. Raise your finger to release it, then select **Done**.
- Select **Adjust**. Gaze at one of the blue squares at the corners of the app, click and hold the clicker, then move your hand to resize the app. Release the clicker, then select **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> In Adjust mode, you can move or resize any hologram.

### Rotate an app

Gaze at the app, and tap and hold with both hands to select it. Rotate the app by keeping one hand steady and moving your other hand around it. When you're done, raise both index fingers.

## Close apps

To close an app that uses 2D view, gaze at it, then select **Close**.

To close an app that uses holographic view, use the bloom gesture to leave holographic view, then select **Close**.

## Pin apps

Keep your favorite apps handy by pinning them to **Start**. In the **All apps** list, gaze at an app to highlight it. Tap and hold until the menu appears, then select **Pin**. To unpin an app, gaze at the app on **Start**, then tap and hold and select **Unpin**.
