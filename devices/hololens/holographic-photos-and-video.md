# Create, share, and view photos and video

Use your HoloLens to take photos and videos that capture the holograms you've placed in your world.

To sync your photos and videos to OneDrive, open the OneDrive app and select **Settings** > **Camera upload**, and then turn on **Camera upload**.

## Take a photo

Use the [bloom](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures) gesture to go to **Start**, then select **Photo**. Use gaze to position the photo frame, then air tap to take the picture. The picture will be saved to your collection in the Photos app.</p>

Want to snap a quick pic? Press the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time. [Where are the buttons?](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12649/hololens-whats-in-the-box)

## Take a video

Use the bloom gesture to go to **Start**, then select **Video**. Use gaze to position the video frame, then air tap to start recording. To stop recording, use bloom once. The video will be saved to your collection in the Photos app.

To start recording more quickly, press and hold the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously until a 3-second countdown begins. To stop recording, tap both buttons.

> [!TIP]
> You can always have Cortana take a photo or a video for you. Just say "Hey Cortana, take a photo" or "Hey Cortana, take a video." [What else can I say to Cortana?](hololens-cortana.md)
