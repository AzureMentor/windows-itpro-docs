# Connect devices and accessories

## Pair Bluetooth devices

Pair a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard with HoloLens, then use them to interact with holograms and to type anywhere you'd use the holographic keyboard. Pair the HoloLens [clicker](hololens-clicker.md) for a different way to interact with HoloLens.

> [!NOTE]
> Other types of Bluetooth devices, such as speakers, headsets, smartphones, and game pads, may appear as available in HoloLens settings, but aren't supported. [Learn more](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=746660).

### Pair a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse

1. Turn on your keyboard or mouse and make it discoverable. The way you make it discoverable depends on the device. Check the device or visit the manufacturer's website to learn how.

1. Go to **Start**, then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Devices** and make sure Bluetooth is on. When you see the device name, select **Pair** and follow the instructions.

### Pair the clicker

1. Use the bloom gesture to go to **Start**, then select **Settings**.

1. Select **Devices** and make sure Bluetooth is on.
1. Use the tip of a pen to press and hold the clicker's pairing button until the status light blinks white. Make sure to hold the button down until the light starts blinking. [Where's the pairing button?](hololens-clicker.md)
1. On the pairing screen, select **Clicker** > **Pair**.
