# Connect to a network

You'll need to be connected to a network to do most things on your HoloLens. [What can I do offline](hololens-offline.md)?

## Connecting for the first time

The first time you use your HoloLens, you'll be guided through connecting to a Wi-Fi network. If you have trouble connecting to Wi-Fi during setup, make sure your network is either open, password protected, or a captive portal network and doesn't require using certificates to connect. After setup, you can connect to other types of Wi-Fi networks.

## Connecting to Wi-Fi after setup

1. Go to **Start**, then select **Settings**.

1. _HoloLens (1st gen) only_ - Use your gaze to position the Settings app, then air tap to place it, or say "Place."

1. Select **Network & Internet** > **Wi-Fi**. If you don't see your network, scroll down the list.

1. Select a network > **Connect**.

1. Type the network password if asked for one, then select **Next**.
