# Set up HoloLens for the first time

The first time you turn on your HoloLens, you'll be guided through calibrating your device, setting up your device, and signing in.  This section walks through the HoloLens (1st gen) first start experience.

In the next section, you'll learn how to work with HoloLens and interact with holograms.  Skip ahead to [Get started with HoloLens (1st gen)](holographic-home.md)

## Before you start

Before you get started, make sure you have the following available:

**A Wi-Fi connection**. You'll need to connect your HoloLens to a Wi-Fi network to set it up. The first time you connect, you'll need an open or password-protected network that doesn't require navigating to a website or using certificates to connect. After setup, you can [use your device offline](hololens-offline.md).

**A Microsoft account**. You'll also need to sign in to HoloLens with a Microsoft account (or with your work account, if your organization owns the device). If you don't have a Microsoft account, go to [account.microsoft.com](http://account.microsoft.com) and set one up for free.

**A safe, well-lit space with no tripping hazards**. [Health and safety info](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=746661).

**The optional comfort accessories** that came with your HoloLens, to help you get the most comfortable fit. [More on fit and comfort](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12632/hololens-fit-your-hololens).

> [!NOTE]
> [Cortana](hololens-cortana.md) is already on and ready to guide you the first time you use your HoloLens (though she won't be able to respond to your questions until after you set up your device). You can turn Cortana off at any time in Cortana's settings.

## Set up your HoloLens

Set up your HoloLens and your user account.

1. The first time you use your HoloLens, you'll be guided through connecting to a Wi-Fi network. If you have trouble connecting to Wi-Fi during setup, make sure your network is either open, password protected, or a captive portal network and doesn't require using certificates to connect. After setup, you can connect to other types of Wi-Fi networks.
1. Sign in to your user account.  You'll choose between **My work or school owns it** and **I own it**.
    - When you choose **My work or school owns it**, you sign in by using an Azure AD account. If your organization uses Azure AD Premium and has configured automatic MDM enrollment, HoloLens will be enrolled in MDM. If your organization does not use Azure AD Premium, automatic MDM enrollment isn't available, so you will need to [enroll HoloLens in device management manually](hololens-enroll-mdm.md#enroll-through-settings-app).
        1. Enter your organizational account information.
        1. Accept the privacy statement.
        1. Sign in by using your Azure AD credentials. This may redirect to your organization's sign-in page.
        1. Continue with device setup.
    - When you choose **I own it**, you sign in by using a Microsoft account. After setup is complete, you can [enroll HoloLens in device management manually](hololens-enroll-mdm.md#enroll-through-settings-app).
        1. Enter your Microsoft account information.
        1. Enter your password. If your Microsoft account requires [two-step verification (2FA)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/microsoft_blog/2013/04/17/microsoft-account-gets-more-secure/), complete the verification process.
1. The device sets your time zone based on information obtained from the Wi-Fi network.
1. Follow the first-start guides to learn how to interact with holograms, control the HoloLens with your voice, and access the start menu.

Congratulations!  Setup is complete and you can begin using HoloLens.
